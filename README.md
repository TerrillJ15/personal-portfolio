# Personal Portfolio

Create a personal portfolio using a template.

Note on personal data. Put as little personal data on your portfolio as possible, that means DO NOT put your phone number, detailed resume, age, address, on your website. These information can be scrapped by hackers and used for social engineering. You can give an email, linkedin, github, and that should be enough.
